2. If the internet is off at launch:
   - A retry option is shown.
3. When the internet is turned on, data automatically loads (or can be manually retried).
4. Used `SharedPreferences` to persist:
   - Favourite author IDs  
   - Deleted author IDs  
   This ensures changes are retained even after restarting the app.

## Notes

- I have uploaded the Android app's screen     recordings and screenshots for all the above-mentioned features.You can find them in the projectâ€™s root folder under:
/screenshotsandrecordings
- As I don't have access to a macOS machine, I wasn't able to test the app on an iOS device or emulator.
- However, I have added the required iOS permission to allow HTTP URLs and also configured the app name and launcher icon.

```xml
<!-- Info.plist -->
<!-- To allow HTTP URL  -->
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
